# CrapAppRemover
Removes those shitty apps that come with Winblows 10

1) Open a Powershell terminal as admin
2) cd to the AppRemover folder
3) Run ./AppRemoverScript.ps1
4) Proffit

If you get an error message stating that the script cannot be loaded, open a Powershell terminal as admin and run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" w/o quotes. Once you've ran the script, you can revert this executing "Set-ExecutionPolicy Default" w/o quotes.
